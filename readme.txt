== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My favorite programming language isn't supported. What can I do? =

Lots of programming languages are actually very similar, and you can get a pretty good result using another language.

However, If you think there's enough demand for your language, and it's supported by [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com), you can fork this pugin on GitHub and add it yourself!
