== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if [insert favorite langauge] isn't supported? =

I've tried my best to include the some of the most common programming languages, but there's a change that yours isn't supported! There are two things you could try. First, many programming langauge syntaxes are very similar. Play around with different languages and see if any produce a good enough result. Give a member of the C family a try. Alternatively, you can fork the repository on GitHub and add it yourself. As long as there's enough demand and Prism.js supports it, you should be good to go!
